# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Solar Irradiance Datasets

## Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on solar irradiance datasets from Togo, Sierra Leone, and Benin. The analysis involves inspecting the data, calculating summary statistics, visualizing trends, and exploring correlations between different variables.

## Data Sources
The datasets used in this project include:
- **Togo Dataset**: Contains observations on solar irradiance and meteorological variables for a specific location in Togo.
- **Sierra Leone Dataset**: Contains similar observations for a location in Sierra Leone.
- **Benin Dataset**: Contains observations for a location in Benin.

## Prerequisites
The following Python libraries are required to run the analysis:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy

To install these libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

## Development Process

### 1. Importing Libraries
The analysis begins by importing the necessary Python libraries, which are essential for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

### 2. Loading Data
Three datasets are loaded using `pandas`. The datasets are stored in CSV files and contain information on various meteorological and solar irradiance variables.

### 3. Data Inspection
The first step involves inspecting the datasets by displaying the first few rows. This helps in understanding the structure of the data and identifying any immediate issues such as missing values or unexpected data types.

### 4. Summary Statistics
For each dataset, summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range are calculated. These statistics provide an overview of the central tendencies and dispersion of the data.

### 5. Visualization Techniques
Various visualization techniques are employed to explore the data further. These include:
- **Histograms**: To observe the frequency distribution of key variables.
- **Scatter Plots**: To investigate relationships between pairs of variables.
- **Heatmaps**: To visualize correlations between multiple variables.
- **Polar Plots**: To analyze wind speed and direction data.

### 6. Correlation Analysis
Correlation matrices and visualizations are used to examine the relationships between different solar irradiance components (GHI, DNI, DHI) and temperature measures (TModA, TModB). This helps in understanding how these variables influence each other.

### 7. Wind and Temperature Analysis
The analysis explores the impact of wind conditions on solar irradiance, as well as the influence of temperature and relative humidity. Polar plots are particularly useful for identifying patterns in wind direction and speed.

### 8. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning steps involve handling missing values, outliers, and any other inconsistencies in the data. This ensures the analysis is based on high-quality, reliable data.

## Usage Instructions
To run the analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
3. Open the `eda_all_datasets.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

### Modifying the Notebook
- To analyze different datasets, modify the paths in the data loading cells to point to your datasets.
- Adjust the analysis and visualizations as necessary to suit the new data.

### Interpreting Outputs
- The outputs include various statistical summaries and visualizations. These should be interpreted in the context of the specific research questions or hypotheses being investigated.

## Results
Key findings from the analysis include:
- Identification of strong correlations between solar irradiance and temperature in some datasets.
- Wind direction and speed showing distinct patterns that could influence solar panel efficiency.
- Variations in solar irradiance across different times of the day and weather conditions.

## Conclusion
This EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of the solar irradiance datasets, revealing key patterns and relationships. Future work could involve more advanced modeling techniques to predict solar power output based on these variables.
